    <h1>Hey… it’s still you.</h1>

    <p>
      Oh hi… I was kind of hoping you'd open this again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since today is Valentine's Day, I just wanted to say something 
      nothing heavy, nothing dramatic.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're genuinely a really nice person.  
      To me, you've always been a little shehzadi type 
      soft, strong, and special in your own way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, we had our emotional chaos.  
      And yes, we're distant now  the way you felt was right.  
      If distance felt necessary, I respect that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because love isn't only about showing too much care or proving things loudly.  
      Sometimes it's about patience.  
      Sometimes it's about knowing when to step back.  
      Sometimes it's about respecting someone even when it isn't easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not forcing anything.  
      I'm not rushing anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      But whenever you feel like coming back  even just to talk  you can.
    </p>

    <p>
      I miss you, Chittu. 🫂
